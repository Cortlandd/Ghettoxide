class ReducerFragmentTest {

    // Note: This is a placeholder test file.
    //
    // The core logic of `ReducerFragment` is tightly coupled to the Android Fragment
    // lifecycle (`onCreate`, `onViewCreated`) and its `viewLifecycleOwner`.
    //
    // Correctly testing this behavior requires an instrumented test environment where
    // a real Fragment can be hosted and its lifecycle can be driven by the test.
    // This is typically done in the `androidTest` source set using a library like
    // `androidx.test.ext.junit` and `Robolectric` or an emulator.
    //
    // The previous attempts to unit test this component were invalid because they
    // tried to mock framework-managed properties (like `viewLifecycleOwner`)
    // on a real object, which is not possible and resulted in MockK exceptions.

    @Test
    fun `this test is a placeholder`() {
        // See the note above for how to properly test this component.
